fgets()

• fgets() is a line-oriented function.
char *fgets(char *str,int n,FILE *fp);

The function reads from the stream pointed to by fp and places
the output into the character array pointed to by str.

It will stop reading when any of the following conditions are true

(1) It has read n-1 characters (one character is reserved for the null-
terminator).

(2) It encounters a new-line character.
(3) It reaches the end of file.
(4) A read error occurs.
• fgets() automatically appends a null-terminator to the data read.
