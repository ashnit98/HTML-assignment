<h2> 1.Tubi </h2>
<p>You don't want to miss the thousands of free movies and TV shows you can stream right now on Tubi.I like to visit the <span style="color:pink;font-weight:italic"> Leaving Soon page </span> to catch freebies before they start to cost somewhere else, but my favorite part of this website for inspiration is Trending On Social â€” I often have no clue what I'm in the mood for, so to see what everyone else is watching right now is awesome.
 For example, a few of the more popular titles people have been streaming over the last month include Friday, Gossip Girl, Sleepover, The Fast and the Furious, and Shooter.
There are dozens of other genres and collections to pick from, too, like exclusives in Only Free on Tubi, and Black Cinema, Foreign Films, Based on a Book, Highly Rated on Rotten Tomatoes, and Cult Classics. There's also a Spanish section and live TV. </p>

<h2> 2. Youtube </h2
<p> I was shocked the first time I found out YouTube has free movies. And no, these aren't poorly filmed videos without subtitles uploaded by some random user. I mean proper, full-length, totally legal movies managed directly by YouTube </p>

<h2> 3.Fandango at Home </h2>
<p> It's a great movie site whether you do or don't know what you want to watch. Films can be filtered by genre, and you can browse by most-watched or release date. All the basic genres are available: action, comedy, crime, romance, and a few others.While it's true that the genres aren't interesting, Fandango at Home makes up for it with their curated lists. Check these out: Big Time Movie Stars, Critically Acclaimed, Hidden Gems, and Most Watched Movies. There are a few hundred videos in each section.  </p>

<h2> 4.Freevee </h2>
<p>Freevee (formerly IMDb TV) is Amazon's collection of free movies. I use this a lot from my TV, but it's just as easily accessible from their website or mobile app. Everything I watch here is easy to find and seems to be high-quality.
Something I like about this site is how the genres and movie collections are organized. For example, if I'm looking through the most popular movies or recently added lists, I can filter by genre and/or subtitle language to make sure I find a movie that's a good fit for me. </p>

<h2> 5.Pluto TV </h2>
<p>Pluto TV is the closest thing I've found to free cable TV. It's owned by Paramount and fully supported by ads, so there's no worry that you might accidentally buy something.
My biggest joy about using this service is that I can just turn it on and let it play. There are hundreds of live channels, so some of them feature news, reality TV, or game shows, but others have full-length movies. </p>
<h2> Audio File </h2>

<h2> 6.Yidio </h2>
<p> I'm so happy I stumbled on Yidio years ago! It's like a search engine for all these other movie sites. It's incredibly handy because it shows where on the internet a movie is available for free.
A search box would be enough, but Yidio goes above and beyond with lots of other sorting and filtering options. These include MPAA rating, decade, genre, IMDb score, and others </p>
